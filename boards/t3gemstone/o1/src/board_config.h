 * This is intentionally minimal for the first "boot + SPI sensors" milestone.
 * The AM67 has no PX4 ADC / PWM-output (io_timer) / USB layer yet, so battery
 * monitoring, RC input and actuator outputs are stubbed out below and marked
 * TODO. Fill them in as the corresponding arch-support pieces land.

/* PX4 High-Resolution Timer -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * These override the defaults baked into the arch HRT
 * (platforms/nuttx/src/px4/ti/am67/hrt/hrt.c). DMTimer0 @ 0x02400000 is the
 * NuttX system tick; the HRT uses DMTimer1. Change here (not in arch code) if
 * a different spare DMTimer must be used.

/* I2C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The only I2C bus enabled and wired on this board is WKUP_I2C0 (WKUP domain,
 * 0x2b200000) -> PX4 bus 3. The AM67 also has MCU_I2C0 (MCU domain,
 * 0x04900000 -> PX4 bus 1), but it carries no peripheral and is not built, so
 * it is not listed. See src/i2c.cpp for the table and mapping.

/* Skip px4_platform_i2c_init()'s eager boot-time probe (a general-call software
 * reset transfer on every declared bus). It is unsafe here: (a) it does not
 * null-check the bus handle, so a bus whose NuttX port is not enabled crashes
 * on I2C_TRANSFER(NULL); and (b) the AM67 I2C functional clock is enabled by
 * the Device Manager only later (the am67_i2c driver brings HW up lazily on the
 * first real transfer), so touching the bus this early is invalid. I2C is
 * instead initialised on demand by i2cdetect / sensor drivers. */

/* SPI ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MCU_MCSPI0 = PX4 logical bus 1 (maps to am67 NuttX port 0, see
 * PX4_BUS_OFFSET in px4_arch/micro_hal.h). Chip selects are driven in HARDWARE
 * by the MCSPI (per-channel FORCE bit), so there are NO chip-select GPIOs; the
 * board's src/spi.cpp encodes each device's MCSPI channel in the
 * px4_spi_bus_device_t::cs_gpio field and the arch spi layer maps devid ->
 * channel from px4_spi_buses.

/* PWM outputs --------------------------------------------------------------
 * Actuator outputs via the PX4 pwm_out module. The am67 arch pwm_servo layer
 * (platforms/nuttx/src/px4/ti/am67/io_pins) drives the copper-verified NuttX
 * EPWM/eCAP lower-halves. Channel/group map (see src/timer_config.cpp):
 *   group 0 = EPWM0  -> ch 0 (A), ch 1 (B)
 *   group 1 = EPWM1  -> ch 2 (A), ch 3 (B)
 *   group 2 = eCAP1  -> ch 4 (APWM, HAT GPIO-16 / A25)
 * EPWM2 is the cooling fan and is deliberately excluded. eCAP0 is unusable: its
