/**

 * T3 Gemstone O1 (AM67 / J722S Cortex-R5F) PX4-specific board init.
 *
 * Called by NuttX during startup via boardctl(BOARDIOC_INIT) once
 * CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT is set. Kept minimal for the first bring-up: the SoC
 * clocks/muxes/power are already set by the Linux Device Manager before
 * remoteproc starts us, and the low-level pin/MPU/console setup happens in the
 * am67 arch layer (arch/arm/src/am67). All this needs to do is bring PX4's
 * platform (HRT, work queues, parameters, uORB) up.
 *
 * TODO (as arch-support lands): register SPI buses for the LPS22DF baro and
 * ICM-20948 IMU, start the sensor drivers, and configure any board GPIO.
