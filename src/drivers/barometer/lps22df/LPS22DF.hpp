 * Driver for the ST LPS22DF barometer connected via SPI.
 *
 * The device runs in continuous mode: the ODR is programmed once and the
 * driver polls the STATUS/output registers at the same rate.  Register
 * addresses, field encodings and sensitivities follow the LPS22DF
 * datasheet (also mirrored by the Linux st_pressure driver).
