/**
 * @file board_reset.c
 *
 * Board reset backend for the TI AM67 / J722S Cortex-R5F.
 *
 * Reset on this platform is fundamentally different from a self-contained
 * Cortex-M flight controller:
 *
 *   - The R5F is not the boot master. It is loaded and started by the Linux
 *     remoteproc framework running on the A-cores. The firmware image is
 *     chosen on the Linux side (/lib/firmware + remoteproc), not by us.
 *   - There is no Cortex-M style self-reset (no NVIC AIRCR/SYSRESETREQ), and
 *     NuttX does not implement up_systemreset() for this core.
 *   - A genuine core reset is owned by the K3 Device Manager (TISCI) or by
 *     Linux (`echo stop/start > /sys/class/remoteproc/.../state`). We have no
 *     TISCI transport here yet.
 *
 * So we cannot truthfully "reboot" ourselves. Rather than silently doing
 * nothing (which would let a corrupted OS keep running after an assert - see
 * board_crashdump.c, which calls board_reset() precisely because RAM is
 * already trashed), board_reset() logs loudly and parks the core in a defined
 * halted state with interrupts disabled. If remoteproc crash-recovery is
 * enabled on the Linux side, it can then detect the stalled core and reload
 * the firmware.
 *
 * TODO: once a TISCI transport exists, replace the halt with a proper core
 * reset request (or an mbox/IPC ping asking Linux to restart us).
